# BN PROJECT

The BN Project is a platform designed for testing trading strategies, encompassing both traditional methodologies and AI-driven approaches. 
Users have the flexibility to create and fine-tune their own strategies to suit their trading preferences.

Currently, the platform is under development, with new features planned for regular release post-launch. 

During this phase, Alpaca paper accounts are utilized for strategy testing, ensuring a robust and reliable trading experience.

## BN.NEXT.CLIENT

BN.NEXT.CLIENT serves as the user interface for the BN Project. The decision to utilize Next.js was driven by its robust capabilities, including server-side and static rendering, which enhance performance and user experience.

In addition to its frontend capabilities, the Next.js backend functions as a proxy, facilitating seamless connections to our microservice architecture. This setup ensures efficient data handling and integration across various services.

For secure and reliable authentication processes, Keycloak is employed, providing a comprehensive solution for identity and access management.
